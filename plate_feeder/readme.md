# Files for feeders mounted directly on the working surface of the PNP.
Made for commonly used tape with components inside. Parametric design available (Fusion 360).
Please note, that the older versions of the files were just for testing and will not be useful to you most likely.
That said, the latest designs are untested as well. But the tape fits in nicely.
