# Drawings for two different designs of mounting plates. 
The smaller on is the same as shown by Stephen in his videos.
The larger design was made by me to add extra space.

I printed the design out on paper (make sure the actual printout it exactly the right scale!) and marked the holes on the steel.
Then I used a drill to drill out all holes, the large hole in the middle of the small plate was cut with a hole cutting drill.
Afterwards the part was cleaned and painted.
