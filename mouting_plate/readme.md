# Drawings for two different designs of mounting plates. 
The smaller one is the same as shown by Stephen in his videos.
The larger design was made by me to add extra space.

## Instructions

Open the pdf file with a viewer / editor such as Foxit reader and open the print dialog.
Use the file with the highest version number.
Print it out over multiple A4 pages (or whatever you have).
Print design out on paper (make sure the actual printout it exactly the right scale!). You may need to experiment a bit.
Glue the paper onto the metal plate and mark the holes.
Then drill out all holes, the large hole in the middle of the small plate can be cut with a hole cutting drill.
Afterwards the part cen be cleaned and painted.
